    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in California cuisine, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/4 can of diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups refried beans</li>
        <li>1 jar beef gravy</li>
        <li>1 can enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups cheedar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped lettuce</li>
    </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 8 minutes; drain excess grease. Mix in half the can of diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, paprika, oregano, 3/4 teaspoon of cumin, and black pepper. Bring meat mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Heat refried beans and 1/4 teaspoon cumin in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Keep beans warm. Mix remaining half of diced tomatoes, beef gravy, and enchilada sauce in a separate saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place tortillas onto a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel; microwave tortillas until they are soft and warm, about 30 seconds. Place a warmed tortilla onto a work surface and spoon 1/4 the beef mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla. Layer 1/4 the bean mixture on top of beef layer and spread 1/4 cup of Cheddar cheese over the bean layer. Fold right and left edges of the tortilla over the ends of the filling and roll up tortilla to make a burrito. Place burrito seam side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas to make 4 burritos.</li>
        <li>Pour gravy sauce over the burritos in the baking dish; top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake burritos in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes. To serve, place each burrito on a serving plate and spoon sauce from baking dish over the burritos. Top each burrito with 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon chopped onion and chopped tomato, and 1/4 cup of chopped lettuce.</li>
